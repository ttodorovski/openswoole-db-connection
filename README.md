OpenSwoole DB connection template

For running the sandbox you can boot up the container through the `docker-compose up` command. The HTTP server is running on port 9501. This is a template or example for running the DB connection on
worker start and there is a lot of room for improvement.

The server initialization is located in sandbox/server.php.
